Open Source Hardware TDCS
=========================

Getting Started
---------------

If you've never used gEDA before, start with this simple
[tutorial](http://hobby-electrons.sourceforge.net/tutorials/gEDA/index.html). Once
you're familiar with the gschem and pcb UI feel free to clone the repo
in github with the [fork button](https://github.com/nocko/tdcs/fork)
or clone the repo using the CLI:

    git clone https://github.com/nocko/tdcs

Interesting Files in the Repo
-----------------------------

* tdcs.sch:

	gschem schematic. Edit this file with *gschem* to add or
	remove components or change the way the components are
	connected.

* tdcs.pcb:
 
  	pcb layout. Edit with *pcb* to change the locations of the
	components on the board or to place new components added in
	gschem.

* attrib:

	template files for the fields that should appear in a bill of
	materials file generated by *gnetlist*

* project:

	gsch2pcb project file. Setup options to import tdcs.sch into
	board.pcb. Options like path to pcb footprints, names of
	schematics to process, and output name.

* gafrc:
 
       Options for gschem. Primarily the location of local schematic
       symbols

* gerber/tdcs/*:
	
	Gerber files generated from the *.pcb files. This directory is
	designed such that the contents can be compressed and sent to
	[OSH Park](http://oshpark.com/) without modification.

* gerber/tdcs.zip:

	Zipfile ready for upload to [OSHPark](http://oshpark.com/) .

* bom.txt:

	Bill of Materials, the components you need to buy to populate
	the board. Auto generated via gnetlist from the schematic.


General Workflow
----------------

1. Add new components or change the circuit diagram in tdcs.sch using
*gschem*.

1. Run: ```gsch2pcb project```

1. Follow the instructions provided by gsch2pcb to insert the new
components.

1. Adjust the pcb layout using *pcb*

1. Export your layout to gerber: ``cd gerbers && ./generate-gerbers.sh``

1. Recreate the BoM: ```gnetlist -g bom -o bom.txt tdcs.sch```

Getting the PCB made
--------------------

I plan to add this to the wiki, but for now this
[post](https://nocko.se/2012/07/30/brain-zapping-is-fun/) is a good
starting point elaborated on slightly below:

 1. In a web browser: Browse to [oshpark.com](http://oshpark.com),
select "Get Started Now", then "Select a file on your
computer". Select tdcs.zip in the ``gerbers/`` directory. Fill out the
name, contact and billing information.

 2. Wait for boards to arrive. While you're waiting you'll want to
checkout bom.txt for a list of parts to order and this
[post](https://nocko.se/2012/07/30/brain-zapping-is-fun/) for some
accessories you'll want.
